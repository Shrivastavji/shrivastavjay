    <p>The Toyota Supra Mk4 is a formidable beast and the JZ engine just keeps on going thanks to Toyota’s first class engineering. Many Toyota cars run great after 20+ years,<br> not just the Supra. This is thanks to Toyota actually overbuilding their engines, meaning that parts are made thicker unnecessarily to allow for better engine health,<br> performance, and reliability.

        Toyota’s JZ engine was so good, that they used it in all kinds of different cars,<br> like the Toyota Soarer and Chaser, proving the engine’s pedigree, and showing that the Supra was bred for performance.
        
       <br> The engine used in the Supra MK4 is such a powerful engine, that it is often used for other car models for modification and performance.</p>
